# Neighborhood Map App

### Overview

This app shows cafes and bars in Indiranagar Bangalore, India. There is a list of cafes on the left side, where a user can search a cafe by typing its name in the input field. The google map displays markers of all the cafes. If the user clicks on a marker, he/she can see an Info Window with name and address details of a cafe.

I used Google Maps API to render the map and Foursquare API to get cafes' names and address details.
